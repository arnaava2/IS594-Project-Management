Lecture Summary

This lecture examined how organizational structure influences project outcomes. Structure determines how information flows, who has authority, and where delays or bottlenecks occur. Even well-designed plans can fail when structural constraints are ignored.

We explored contrasts such as centralized versus decentralized decision-making and hierarchical versus networked teams. These structural choices shape coordination costs and the speed at which issues surface.

A key insight was that project managers often do not directly control the structure. Instead, effective project management involves working within existing structures and adjusting workflows to align with organizational realities.
