Lecture Summary

This lecture focused on understanding why projects fail. Failure was framed as a gradual process rather than a sudden event. Common contributors include scope creep, unclear ownership, and silent assumptions.

We discussed the importance of early warning signals such as increasing rework, coordination overhead, and inconsistent communication. Effective project management involves designing systems that reveal problems early.

Failure, when analyzed properly, provides valuable information about system weaknesses.
