Lecture Summary

This lecture extended the discussion of Waterfall by analyzing its appropriate use cases and failure modes. Waterfall can work well in stable domains where systems are well understood and change is expensive or dangerous.

At the same time, Waterfall tends to delay feedback. When fundamental flaws are discovered late, the cost of correction is extremely high. Once momentum builds, organizations often continue despite warning signs.

The key takeaway was that Waterfall is not inherently flawed, but it is frequently misapplied to complex and evolving problems.
