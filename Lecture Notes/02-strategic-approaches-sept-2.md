Lecture Summary

This lecture focused on strategy as the foundation of project management. Strategy was defined as making choices under constraints, not as optimizing execution. Before deciding how to manage a project, it is necessary to ask whether the project itself is well-defined, justified, and aligned with broader goals.

We discussed frameworks such as SWOT, PEST, and Five Forces as tools to structure thinking about context. These frameworks do not produce answers by themselves; instead, they help surface assumptions, trade-offs, and external pressures that shape feasibility.

One of the strongest takeaways was that projects often fail even when executed well because they are strategically misaligned. Efficient execution cannot compensate for solving the wrong problem.
