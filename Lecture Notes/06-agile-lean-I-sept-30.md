Lecture Summary

Agile and Lean approaches were introduced as responses to environments characterized by uncertainty and learning. Agile prioritizes short cycles, frequent feedback, and working outputs over detailed upfront planning.

Lean thinking focuses on improving flow by reducing waste, minimizing handoffs, and optimizing the system as a whole. Instead of maximizing efficiency at individual steps, Lean emphasizes overall system performance.

This lecture clarified that Agile is not simply about speed, but about managing uncertainty through iteration.
