Lecture Summary

In the first lecture, project management was framed as a way of thinking and reasoning, not simply a set of tools or templates. The emphasis was on understanding projects as complex systems that combine technical work, organizational structures, human behavior, and uncertainty.

A key idea introduced was that projects are sociotechnical systems. This means outcomes are shaped not only by plans or tools, but by how people interact with those tools within institutional and social constraints. Most project failures cannot be traced to a single mistake; instead, they emerge from misalignment across the system.

Another important theme was that uncertainty is unavoidable. Planning does not remove uncertainty—it changes where it appears. As a result, good project management is less about prediction and more about judgment, adaptation, and learning over time.
