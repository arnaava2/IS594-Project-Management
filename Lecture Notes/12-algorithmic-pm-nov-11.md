Lecture Summary

This lecture explored the use of algorithms in project management, including scheduling, resource allocation, and dependency modeling. Automation can increase efficiency but also introduces new risks.

Concerns included reduced transparency, hidden assumptions, and over-reliance on quantitative optimization. A recurring question was which decisions should remain human-led.

The lecture emphasized that algorithms should support judgment, not replace it.
