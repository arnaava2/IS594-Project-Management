Lecture Summary

Waterfall was presented as a structured approach built on the assumption that requirements can be identified early and remain stable. The method emphasizes linear progression, extensive documentation, and clearly defined phases.

The strengths of Waterfall include predictability, traceability, and accountability. These qualities are especially valuable in environments where errors are costly and compliance is critical.

However, the lecture also emphasized that Waterfall’s effectiveness depends heavily on the validity of its assumptions. When uncertainty is high or requirements evolve, the method becomes increasingly brittle.
