Lecture Summary

The final lecture connected course themes to open-source and distributed work. Open-source projects demonstrate how documentation, transparency, and asynchronous collaboration enable coordination without traditional hierarchies.

Repositories were framed as coordination systems that integrate technical infrastructure with social norms. This reinforced the idea that GitHub repositories are not just storage spaces, but are central to modern project management practice.
