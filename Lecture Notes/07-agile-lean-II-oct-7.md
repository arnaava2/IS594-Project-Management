Lecture Summary

This lecture examined Agile methods in practice, including sprints, backlogs, and retrospectives. These structures introduce discipline by enforcing regular checkpoints and continuous reflection.

We also discussed common Agile failure modes. Without clear goals and accountability, Agile can devolve into uncontrolled iteration. Agile does not eliminate planning; it changes when and how planning occurs.

The main insight was that Agile succeeds when teams balance flexibility with structure.
