Lecture Summary

This lecture moved from individual mistakes to systemic failures. Cascading effects, hidden dependencies, and delayed feedback loops make complex systems particularly vulnerable.

Tools such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) were introduced to anticipate how systems might break down. Rather than trying to prevent all failures, the focus was on building resilience and recovery capacity.

A central theme was that robust projects are designed to fail safely.
